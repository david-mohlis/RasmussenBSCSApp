# RasmussenBSCSApp
This project was for my Universal Windows Application development course. This app is meant for Rasmussen students to view the B.S. in Computer Science degree program. Students can enter class information such as grades and instructor information, view degree program course information, view faculty information (fictitious names and bio), and student checklists.
